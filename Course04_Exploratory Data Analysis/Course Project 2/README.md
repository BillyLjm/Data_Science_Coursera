# Course Project 2: PM2.5 Pollution

## Description
This is an assignment to test the ability to choose what graphs to plot & also ability to use ggplot & base plot.  
We were asked to plot graphs which illustrate certain trends, sometimes in a specific plotting system.  
The exact layout of the graphs is not specified & sometimes you have to decide between multi-panel plots or several lines in a single axis.
