# Getting and Cleaning Data

Quizzes I've done for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" MOOC on Coursera.  
The codes are transcripts of what I typed to get the answers for the quizzes, and some pretty printing.  
Some questions do not require coding & there will be no code transcripts for these.  
The actual questions will be summarised as comments above each relevant block of code.
